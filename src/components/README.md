# components/
Atomic jsx components that act as smarter HTML tags go here. Each Component/
will have a Component.jsx file and a corresponding Component.css file if
necessary. The export.jsx file's sole purpose is to import and export every
Component.jsx file in the components/ directory. This will make using these
components in other files much easier.

## Naming Convention
`components/
  Component/
    Component.jsx
    Component.css`
